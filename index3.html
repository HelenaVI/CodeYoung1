    <h1><i>Takoma Maryland</i></h1>
    <p>This is the roscoe the ruster statue. It was created in 2000 by the sculptor Normon Greene. The statue was inspired by the real roscoe. For 10 years Roscoe the Rooster Takoma Park as he pleased.  Drivers stopped for him and people gave him with food and shelter, and soon the police and animal control gave up on trying to catch him. In 1999 roscoe died in a car crash, so they made the statue as a reminder of him.</p>
