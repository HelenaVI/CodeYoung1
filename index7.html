            <p>I attend to <b>Samuel Ogel Middle School.</b> It's from 6th to 8th grade and is most known for our sports. We have been undifeated in basketball for the past 2 years and girls basketball for 1 year. The same goes for a lot of our other sports. There are currently 826 students enrolled and we are are the 13 best school in the county.<i> My school is extremely diverse</i> having 61% Black, 20% Hispanic, 13% White, 4% Asian, and 2% students are Two or more races. Our school also has a lot of fun activities like pep rally's, sport games, and service learning opportunities. I love my school and i think it's very fun.</p>
